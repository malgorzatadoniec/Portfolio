## About me

I am a graduate of the course preparing for work as a manual tester, during which I gained theoretical knowledge in the field of the ISTQB Certificate and practical knowledge, allowing me to
take my first steps in the profession.

Currently, as part of the internship program at CGI, I am developing my practical skills as a tester and analyst. The project I am working on concerns the development of a data warehouse for an
external client from insurance industry.

In my free time, I learn on my own basics of Python, HTML, CSS and the Cypress tool.

My goals for the near future are:
- develop knowledge of the Cypress tool
- learning the basics of working with tools such as Postman and Selenium
- develop knowledge of HTML, CSS and Java Script
- develop knowledge of Python
